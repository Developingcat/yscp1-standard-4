Question 2: Sum of Numbers in a List
Description: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the numbers using a for loop. 
The program should print the total sum at the end.
'''

# This program will calculate the sum of numbers in a list

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  # List of numbers

# Initialize a variable to hold the sum
total_sum = 0

# This is just asking to add all the numbers in the list
# Think of it like the multiplication table for question 3, very similar possibly?  

for i in range(1):
    resultsOne = 20 + 10 # Equals 30 
    resultsTwo = 30 + 40 # Equals 70 
    resultsThree = resultsTwo + resultsOne # This equals 100  
    total_sum = 50 + resultsThree # This equals 150 
    print(total_sum)
     


# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers
